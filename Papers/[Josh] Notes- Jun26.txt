Notes:

Towards an Access Control System for Mobile P2P Collaborative Environments
-implemented in MObile Teamwork Infrastructure for Organizations Networking
-security related p2p issues
-proposal of 3 methodologies for ensuring security in p2p networks.

Consistency Management among replicas in P2P Mobile Ad hoc Networks
-Data Replication for disconnected peers
-region based data consistency
	-proxy (manager) & peer (user)
-use of "quorums" in groups (for global consistency)
	-minimum number of agreeing peers
-other types of consistency mgmt
	-Global, Local, Hop-Count based, Time-based, Peer-based, Hybrid, App-based
-Read/Writes are on a Quorum basis
-Tested different configurations based on
	-Quorum Size, Write Freq, Area Size

P2P Based Mobile Video on Demand with Layered Video Distribution
-streaming live media from server AND peers
-segmenetation of video into "slices" vs "layers"
-layering is based off of bandwidth speed of peers
-aims to solve the problem of peers having different bandwidths

Agent Mediated P2P Mobile Service Oriented Architecture
-all units have to be, and are, independent
-agents are programs that respond depending on the current state of the environment
-usage of mobile proxies that act as "Agent Servers"
