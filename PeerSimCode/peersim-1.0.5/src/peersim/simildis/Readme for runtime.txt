How to compare the runtiem of the two update methods?

1- Run the SimilarityDAGNoDummy.java that read a trace file and updates the graph statically. 
2- Run the Simulator.java and provide the configuration file. In the configuration file there is an property, 
"control.3su.runtime_file" that simulator directs tha runtime results to that file. 

3- After having the abovefiles, run the "ProcessRuntimeResult.java" file and provide the result file from static and 
simulation run. It processes these files and generates a single combined file that containes the comparision results.

4- Use the R script "RuntimeComparision.R" to plot the runtime result. 
 
*  In the simulator or in the static run, the root node should be specified explicitly, and it should be one of
   the nodes that appear in the first record. 

** The properties "simulation.cycles" and "control.1tr.total_lines" are set to the total lines in the trace file, 
   and "control.1tr.line_per_cycle" is set to 1.
