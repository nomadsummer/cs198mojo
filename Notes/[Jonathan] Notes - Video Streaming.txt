Performance analysis of peer-to-peer video streaming systems with tree and forest topology
	*The video stream
		-time interval of frame with respect to the entire video stream
		-sub-frames = part of the whole frame, ex. layered coding
	*Segments
		-at application layer: sub-frames -> segments
		-segments = sub-frames with the same offset
	*Sources and trees
		-content is distributed among all peers in different trees
		-source = root node
		-root sequentially sends segments to its children depending on frame interval
		-number of trees is a multiple of the number of sub-frames per frame
		-a number of them transports segments with the same sub-frame offset
	*Peers' operation
		-download queue -> packets received from parent peers
		-reassembles the stream in an overlay buffer
		-complete segments are sent to all children peers
		-frames are extracted from playout buffer ready for viewing
	*Playout buffer
		-assembles the stream
		-frees space when all the frames of a segment has been extracted
		-starts the video stream when the playback threshold is reached
		-playback threshold is checked for every sub-frame offset
	*Join and leave
	(Every peer must be at least in the transporting trees for the video to play)
		Joining
		-depends on free download bandwidth
		-sub-frame offsets are chosen randomly
		-for every offset, peer selects parent peer in all transporting trees with sufficient free upload band width
		-will only receive from parent after a time interval X (identification and selection of the new peer)
		Leaving
		-peers can leave without notification
		-children peers of disconnected peer will wait for a time interval Y before attempting to find a new parent

	Rejoin time = Y + X
	Average permanence time of peers = time interval from join to leave
	Playback threshold = threshold in peer's playout buffer (measured in seconds)

	*Factors to consider
		-playback delay  = time interval from when source provides content and it is extracted from peer's playout buffer
		-received frames and sub-frames ratios = presence or absence of sub-frames when the playback threshold is reached
