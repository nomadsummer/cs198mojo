Towards Minimum Traffic Cost and Minimum Response Latency: A Novel Dynamic Query Protocol in Unstructured P2P Networks
	*Controlled-flooding Algorithms
		-Expanding Ring Protocol : low response delay, high traffic cost
		-Random-walk  based Protocols : low traffic, high latency, enhanced scalability, results vary for diff. topologies,
										good for energy-constrained applications
	*Dynamic Query
		-Probe phase ("census")
		-Interative flooding phase

A Trust-Enhanced Topology Adaptation Protocol for Unstructured P2P Overlays
	*Beta Reputation System
		-centralized probabilistic trust model based on beta distribution
		-can't cope with misleading information
	*Maximum Likelihood Estimation
		-rough estimate of performance

Analysis and improvement on Chord protocol for structured P2P
	*Chord
		-does not take into account physical network characteristics
		-considers the number of hops and not network latency
		-too many messages
